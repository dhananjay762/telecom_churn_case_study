# Telecom Churn Case Study

On average it’s cheaper and easier to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones. An increasing number of top executives are refocusing their efforts on toward customer retention. Let’s break down Telecom customer churn.

In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn.

In this project, we will analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn and identify the main indicators of churn. There are two main models of payment in the telecom industry - 
1. Postpaid model, when customers want to switch to another operator, they usually inform the existing operator to terminate the services, and you directly know that this is an instance of churn. 
2. Prepaid Model, customers who want to switch to another network can simply stop using the services without any notice, and it is hard to know whether someone has actually churned or is simply not using the services temporarily

There are various ways to define churn - 
1. Revenue-based churn: Customers who have not utilized any revenue-generating facilities such as mobile internet, outgoing calls, SMS etc. over a given period of time.  
2. Usage-based churn: Customers who have not done any usage, either incoming or outgoing - in terms of calls, internet etc. over a period of time.
In this project, we will use the usage-based definition to define churn.
